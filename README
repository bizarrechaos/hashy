# Project Title

hashy is a command line tool that, when ran and given a filepath as an argument, will return multiple hashes for the file.
Supported hashes are md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, and ssdeep.

Currently all hashes are output, there is no way to filter the output.

The main goal of this project was to get familar with rust, while also creating a tool useful in malware analysis.
